Prototype of an inheritance simulation.

User starts with 8 parents.

Each cross produces 8 offspring.

User can make 5 crosses. Any two plants can be crossed.

The goal is to make a white, non-hairy plant with high root size, low branching, high resistance to viruses and flies, and low cyanide content. 

### Genes

6 genes are used, each with its own type of inheritance and number of alleles.

1. Resistance to whitefly - recessive - 3 alleles
2. Hairiness - incomplete dominance - 2 alleles
3. Resistance to virus (1) - dominant - 2 alleles
4. Resistance to virus (2) - recessive - 2 alleles
5. Cyanide - incomplete dominance - 3 alleles
6. Vitamin A - incomplete dominance - 2 alleles


### Pseudo-genes

1. branching
2. dry-matter yield
